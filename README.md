# About it
Windows activation is the process of verifying that a copy of the Windows operating system is properly licensed and not being used on more devices than the license allows. When you activate Windows, the system checks to see that the product key being used is valid and has not been used on more devices than the license allows.

When you install Windows on a device, you will be prompted to enter a product key. This key is used to activate Windows and ensure that it is being used legally. Once you enter the product key and activate Windows, the system will be fully functional and you will be able to use all of its features.

Activation helps to prevent software piracy and ensures that only legitimate copies of Windows are in use. After activation, you may have to do a periodic check-in with Microsoft servers to confirm that the copy of Windows is still properly licensed.

# Legal or Illegal?
Activating Windows using a Python script or any other method that bypasses or alters the normal activation process would be considered a violation of the Windows license agreement and would be illegal.

Creating, distributing or using software or scripts that are intended to bypass software protection or license management, also known as software cracking, is illegal and punishable by law in many countries.

It's important to respect the terms of service agreements and guidelines set by Microsoft, and use the software in a legal and responsible manner.

Additionally, using pirated or unlicensed copies of Windows can put your computer at risk of security vulnerabilities, malware and other malicious software, and can also lead to poor performance and stability issues.

I strongly recommend purchasing a legal copy of Windows and activating it through the official process to ensure that you have a stable, secure and fully functional version of the operating system.
